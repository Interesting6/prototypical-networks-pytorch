# Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning
It is a re-implementation for paper "Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning" in PyTorch.


It mainly contains five parts:
* loadData.py used to load data
* protoNet.py used to create a model
* myutils.py is some tools that will be used
* train.py used to train the model
* test.py used to evaluation


Our results model realized:
* On Omniglot dataset with 60-way 
  * 5-shot: 99.59% (99.7% in paper)


Experiment requirements:
* Python3
* torch 1.0
* torchvision 0.2.2
